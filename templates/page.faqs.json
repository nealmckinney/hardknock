Hardknock helmets are designed around the innovative Nuro Core to help protect against brain torque, the force that causes concussion and traumatic brain injury (TBI). <br/><br/></p>"

            "answer": "<p>Cleaning a Hardknock helmet is no different than cleaning a standard foam helmet. Hardknock helmets can be washed with a solution of mild soap and water. Avoid chemicals and solvents that can damage the helmet. Lightly wash using a soft cloth and allow your helmet to air dry in an open area. For long-term care, store your helmet in a cool, dry place when it’s not in use. Avoid excessive high-heat environments that can damage the liner or shell. Do not attempt to remove the Nuro Core, doing so may result in damage to the helmet and void of product warranties.<br/><br/></p>"

            "answer": "<p>Hardknock helmets are built to be durable. That said,every helmet has a limited lifespan in use and should be replaced when it shows obvious signs of wear and tear. Most helmet manufacturers recommend replacing a helmet after three years, however a helmet should always be replaced if it has been damaged or has been involved in a crash.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>"
